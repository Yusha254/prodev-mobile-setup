# Mobile Development Setup

## Objective
This project focuses on setting up the **Expo Go** environment to enable smooth mobile app development using the **Expo Framework** for React Native. Expo simplifies mobile development and testing by allowing developers to run apps directly on physical devices without the need for emulators.

## Prerequisites
Before setting up Expo Go, ensure the following are already installed:
- **Node.js LTS**
- **VS Code**
- **macOS**, **Linux**, or **Windows**
- **Expo Go** on your physical device (Android/iOS)

## Why Expo Go?
Expo Go provides an efficient and cost-effective solution for testing React Native apps. It eliminates the need for device emulators, allowing developers to preview apps instantly on real hardware across both iOS and Android.

## Setup Process
1. Visit the official Expo Go page: [https://expo.dev/go](https://expo.dev/go)
2. Choose the latest SDK version.
3. Install Expo Go:
   - **Android:** via Google Play Store  
   - **iOS:** via Apple App Store
4. Open the Expo Go app on your device.
5. Log in or create a new account.

## My Setup Notes
I already had **Expo Go** installed and configured on my phone from previous React Native projects. Setup verification was successful â€” I can run and preview projects directly through Expo Go without issues.
